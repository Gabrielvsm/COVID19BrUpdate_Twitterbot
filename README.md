This project was made with study purposes and with the intention to inform about cases of coronavirus on my country (Brazil). I used the [Twit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit) module to access and post the tweets and the [Covid19-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/covid19-api) to gather the data about the cases in Brazil.
